# Surfs Up

**You will analyze climate data using Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.**
## Overview
We need investors for a *Surf and Ice Cream Shop* business located in a city called Oahu, Hawaii. So we decided to determine if the business is sustainable by performing an analysis on the temperature, so that investors can see if theres a viable option
## Results
As we can see:
- **June**:
    - Average temperature: **74.94°F**
    - Min temperature: **64°F**
    - Max temperature: **85°F**
- **December**:
    - Average temperature: **71.04°F**
    - Min temperature: **56°F**
    - Max temperature: **83°F**

*December*

That means that there´s almost only a 4° variation through summer and winter, which makes a great place for surfing due to its **great weather** almost all year

## Summary

Opening a surf shop would be a smart investment, just by looking at the temperature results. To dive a little deeper we decided to make another analysis, this time comparing precipitations data in both months
 - **June**:
    - Average precipitation: **0.136 inches per day**
    - Max precipitation is **4.43 inches on a single day**
- **December**:
    - Average precipitation: **0.217 inches per day**
    - Max precipitation is **6.42 inches on a single day**

By analysing these data we can realize that even it barely rain all year, there are also few days with excesive rain, that will help to make a responsible vacation destination.
